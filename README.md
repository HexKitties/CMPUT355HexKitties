We are team "HexKitties," HexKitties is our first group project using the agile development method.

HexKitties is an offline-storage, AI-based learning, python-based local hex game, which combing AI player , visualizer, tutor functionality.

  - You can play with your friend
  - Train hex AI and play versus our AI player trained using monte carlo tree search, virtual connection algorithm in hex, UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees
  - able to export and reuse prepared files 
  - implement using Python with UI in Pygame


# New Features!

### Tech

HexKitties uses several open-source projects to work properly; we have the reference on the end
Our key algorithms are Mini max tree and Monte-Carlo tree search
